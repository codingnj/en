[{"content":"Social Security, Medicare Fight Kicks Off With Biden Budget The president is proposing a Medicare solvency plan and warning that Republicans would cut entitlements, a claim Trump rejects\n这句话的含义是，总统正在提议一个确保医疗保险（Medicare）财务稳定的计划，并警告说共和党人会削减权利性福利（entitlements），这是特朗普（Trump）所拒绝的主张。\n这里：\nMedicare solvency plan 指的是一项旨在确保美国医疗保险系统财务上可持续的计划。医疗保险是美国的一项联邦健康保险计划，主要服务于65岁以上的老年人和某些残疾人。 warning that Republicans would cut entitlements 表示总统在提出这个计划的同时，还警告称共和党人可能会削减权利性福利。权利性福利通常指根据法律规定，符合特定条件的人有权获得的福利，如社会保障、医疗保险等。 a claim Trump rejects 指的是特朗普对于共和党人会削减权利性福利这一说法的拒绝或否认。这里暗示了政治上的争论和对立。 综上所述，这句话反映了美国医疗保险系统财务稳定计划的提议，以及围绕这个议题的政治争议。\n在这个上下文中，“solvency”和“entitlement”有特定的含义：\nSolvency “Solvency”在财务和经济领域中指的是一个个体或机构支付债务的能力，特别是在长期内能够满足其债务义务的能力。在提到“Medicare solvency plan”时，这指的是一项计划，旨在确保美国医疗保险（Medicare）系统财务上的稳定和可持续性，即确保该系统能够长期支付其赔付和运营费用，不会因为资金不足而破产或无法履行其对受益人的义务。\nEntitlement “Entitlement”在政策和法律语境中，通常指根据法律或政策规定，个人或团体有权获得的某种福利或服务。这些福利通常是基于特定的资格条件，如年龄、收入或残疾状况。在这里提到的“cut entitlements”（削减权利性福利）意味着减少或限制人们根据这些法律或政策所拥有的获得特定福利（如社会保障金、医疗保险等）的权利。\n因此，当总统提出“Medicare solvency plan”并警告共和党可能“cut entitlements”时，这表明了一方面在寻求确保医疗保险系统的财务健康，另一方面则是关于政治争议，即对于是否应该减少公民通过法律有权获得的福利的争论。\nWASHINGTON—President Biden’s budget blueprint will kick off an election-year fight over Medicare and Social Security, as the president and his presumed Republican opponent, Donald Trump, scramble to lock down the support of the older voters who could decide which man occupies the Oval Office next year.\n翻译：\n华盛顿——总统拜登的预算蓝图将在选举年引发一场关于医疗保险和社会保障的争论，因为总统和他假定的共和党对手唐纳德·特朗普正急于争取那些可能决定明年谁将入主白宫的老年选民的支持。\n解释：\nblueprint \u0026ldquo;Blueprint\u0026rdquo; 在这里指的是一个详细的计划或提案，通常用于指导未来的行动或决策。在政策和政治语境中，\u0026ldquo;blueprint\u0026rdquo; 强调了这是一份精心设计的、旨在实现特定目标或愿景的计划。\nscramble \u0026ldquo;Scramble\u0026rdquo; 在这个上下文中描述了一种急迫的、竞争激烈的努力，尤其是在有限的时间内争取或确保某事的发生。这里，它用来形容总统拜登和唐纳德·特朗普在选举年里为了赢得老年选民的支持而进行的紧张且激烈的竞争行动。\n翻译：\n拜登为即将到来的财政年度提出的预算方案于周一发布，将重启一个通过增加年收入超过40万美元的人的工资、投资收益和自雇收入的税收来稳定医疗保险的计划。根据负责监督该计划的联邦机构——医疗保险和医疗补助服务中心（CMS）的首席精算师在周一的一封信中称，该提案将使一个关键的医疗保险信托基金的财务稳定性“无限期”延长。\n解释：\nrevive \u0026ldquo;Revive\u0026rdquo; 意味着恢复、复兴或重新开始某事。在这个上下文中，它指的是拜登政府计划重新推动之前提出但可能未实施或暂停的政策或方案，旨在通过增税措施来稳定医疗保险系统。\nindefinitely \u0026ldquo;Indefinitely\u0026rdquo; 表示无限期、不确定的时间长度，没有明确的结束时间。这里指的是提案预计将使医疗保险信托基金的财务稳定性得到长期甚至无限期的延续，没有具体的结束时间或期限。\nactuary \u0026ldquo;Actuary\u0026rdquo; 是指精算师，他们是专业人士，利用数学、统计和财务理论来分析风险和不确定性，尤其是在保险和金融行业中。这里提到的首席精算师负责为医疗保险和医疗补助服务中心（CMS）提供关于该提案财务影响的专业评估。\noversee \u0026ldquo;Oversee\u0026rdquo; 指的是监督、管理或审查某事或某个过程。这里指的是医疗保险和医疗补助服务中心（CMS）作为一个联邦机构，负责监管和管理医疗保险计划，确保其按照规定和目标正常运作。\nThe president used last week’s State of the Union speech to raise the prospect that Republicans could cut Medicare and Social Security benefits if they win back the White House and take full control of Congress, prompting an angry response from GOP lawmakers, who shouted, “Liar!” as he spoke.\n“Many of my friends on the other side of the aisle want to put Social Security on the chopping block,” Biden said during the speech. “If anyone here tries to cut Social Security or Medicare or raise the retirement age, I will stop you.”\nTrump has pushed the Republican party away from the longstanding conservative goal of reworking the programs, which both face shortfalls over the coming decade. Trump has sought to largely leave the programs intact. “Republicans have no plan to cut Social Security, a made up story by Crooked Joe!” Trump wrote on his social-media platform, Truth Social, during Biden’s address. But doing nothing is also a problem. Inaction would lead to automatic benefit cuts in Social Security—but not until after either man’s second term ends.\nThe government-run Medicare program provides health insurance for adults 65 and older, as well as some younger people with disabilities. Nearly 67 million people are enrolled in the program, which is expected to cost nearly $900 billion this year. Social Security is another government-run program for seniors and people with disabilities. The Biden administration estimates that roughly 68 million Americans will receive a monthly Social Security benefit in 2024, with $1.5 trillion in benefits projected to be distributed over the course of the year.\nThe programs, which are funded mostly by payroll tax revenue, are incredibly popular but also quite expensive. They currently pay out more in benefits than they bring in through revenue, which has led to calls from members of both parties for changes. But the politics and math are daunting because the main levers for addressing the problem are benefit cuts and tax increases, both of which face opposition on Capitol Hill.\nBiden holds a narrow lead among older voters with eight months until Election Day. In a Wall Street Journal poll conducted last month, 48% of voters 65 and older said they would support Biden in a head-to-head matchup with Trump. Forty-six percent said they would vote for Trump. Older voters are considered by political strategists of both parties as one of the demographic groups that is most likely to show up at the polls.\nBiden and his allies—in criticizing Republicans’ approach—have latched onto a sweeping economic plan released by Sen. Rick Scott (R., Fla.) in 2022 that initially proposed sunsetting all federal legislation in five years. Amid fierce pushback from his fellow Republicans, including Trump and Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Senate GOP leader, Scott revised the plan, clarifying last year that he would exempt Social Security, Medicare and veterans programs from the sunset provision.\nAs Republican lawmakers have sought to shrink the deficit, some fiscal conservatives have proposed changes to entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare. A budget proposal put forward last year by the Republican Study Committee, which represents a swath of conservatives in the House, calls for saving money by bumping up the eligibility ages for full benefits for Social Security and Medicare. Last year, then-Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley proposed changing the retirement age for people currently in their 20s, a plan Trump’s campaign criticized. Haley dropped out of the presidential race earlier this month.\nOn CNBC Monday, Trump said, “there is a lot you can do in terms of entitlements in terms of cutting” before vaguely discussing theft and bad management and veering onto other disconnected topics. Democrats quickly seized on the remarks. Trump campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said the former president would protect Social Security and Medicare in a second term, but didn’t detail a plan for ensuring the solvency of the programs.\nBiden’s budget proposal, which is unlikely to win congressional approval, would raise Medicare taxes on wages and self-employment income to 5% from 3.8% for earners making more than $400,000 a year, a tax that comes atop regular income taxes. In addition, the plan would increase an existing 3.8% tax that applies to net investment income for that same group of high earners, and direct the revenue from the tax to Medicare’s hospital-insurance fund. Biden would change the law to make sure those same high earners pay Medicare taxes on their income from active businesses, closing a gap that he used to lower taxes on his own book and speech income while out of office.\nBiden would also direct savings from his proposal to lower the cost of prescription drugs for Medicare recipients into the hospital fund.\n“With this additional revenue stream, the [Medicare hospital-insurance] program would be sufficiently funded indefinitely,” Paul Spitalnic, the chief actuary at CMS wrote in a letter reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. Only hospital expenses are covered by Medicare’s trust fund. Doctor’s visits, medical equipment, prescription drugs and other things are covered by premiums and general Treasury Department revenue.\nTax increases are often seen as nonstarters by Republicans, however, which means the changes are more likely to get discussed on the campaign trail this year than in the halls of Congress. Still, with large parts of the Trump tax cuts expiring after 2025, a broad reworking of the tax code could be on the table next year, giving the next president a lot of input into the shape of any negotiations.\nBiden’s Medicare solvency plan largely echoes the one he first proposed in last year’s budget blueprint. At the time, CMS’s actuary projected that the additional revenue would fund the program for at least 25 years. Last year, the actuarial model used to come up with the estimate was limited to a 25-year window. This year, that window was extended to 75 years so that the White House could get a more detailed sense of how long the trust fund’s solvency would last, according to an administration official.\nThe president didn’t outline a detailed plan for Social Security solvency in his budget blueprint, instead saying he would work with Congress to protect the program and outlining principles. During his 2020 presidential campaign, Biden proposed increasing Social Security payroll taxes for people making more than $400,000 a year in a bid to bolster the program. (Currently, Social Security taxes of 6.2% each on employees and employers stop once wages and self-employment income reach $168,600.)\nThat proposal hasn’t been included in any of Biden’s budget proposals since he took office and it wasn’t included Monday. But Shalanda Young, director of the Office of Management and Budget, alluded to that idea Monday when asked about the lack of details on Social Security.\n“If you make a million dollars in this country, you are done paying your Social Security taxes sometime in February,” she said. “Is that fair? We don’t think so.”\nA bill sponsored by most House Democrats would raise Social Security taxes on high-income households and expand benefits, but Democrats didn’t vote on it when they controlled Congress.\nMaya MacGuineas, the president of the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said neither Biden nor Trump is doing enough to tackle the problems facing the programs.\nReserves in a key Social Security trust fund are expected to run low in 2033, at which time benefits would be automatically reduced unless Congress acts. If nothing is done to salvage the program, Medicare’s hospital-insurance fund is projected to be depleted in 2031.\n“It’s nothing but politics. There needs to be a discussion of the various trade-offs between the various options,” MacGuineas said. “The fact that we’re about to have a campaign where we are likely to have two nominees fighting against each other about who would do more to do nothing to fix Social Security creates a huge mandate for doing nothing and doesn’t do anything to educate the country about what’s actually needed.”\nWrite to Andrew Restuccia at andrew.restuccia@wsj.com and Richard Rubin at richard.rubin@wsj.com\n","permalink":"https://codingnj.github.io/en/posts/info/info0003/","summary":"Social Security, Medicare Fight Kicks Off With Biden Budget The president is proposing a Medicare solvency plan and warning that Republicans would cut entitlements, a claim Trump rejects\n这句话的含义是，总统正在提议一个确保医疗保险（Medicare）财务稳定的计划，并警告说共和党人会削减权利性福利（entitlements），这是特朗普（Trump）所拒绝的主张。\n这里：\nMedicare solvency plan 指的是一项旨在确保美国医疗保险系统财务上可持续的计划。医疗保险是美国的一项联邦健康保险计划，主要服务于65岁以上的老年人和某些残疾人。 warning that Republicans would cut entitlements 表示总统在提出这个计划的同时，还警告称共和党人可能会削减权利性福利。权利性福利通常指根据法律规定，符合特定条件的人有权获得的福利，如社会保障、医疗保险等。 a claim Trump rejects 指的是特朗普对于共和党人会削减权利性福利这一说法的拒绝或否认。这里暗示了政治上的争论和对立。 综上所述，这句话反映了美国医疗保险系统财务稳定计划的提议，以及围绕这个议题的政治争议。\n在这个上下文中，“solvency”和“entitlement”有特定的含义：\nSolvency “Solvency”在财务和经济领域中指的是一个个体或机构支付债务的能力，特别是在长期内能够满足其债务义务的能力。在提到“Medicare solvency plan”时，这指的是一项计划，旨在确保美国医疗保险（Medicare）系统财务上的稳定和可持续性，即确保该系统能够长期支付其赔付和运营费用，不会因为资金不足而破产或无法履行其对受益人的义务。\nEntitlement “Entitlement”在政策和法律语境中，通常指根据法律或政策规定，个人或团体有权获得的某种福利或服务。这些福利通常是基于特定的资格条件，如年龄、收入或残疾状况。在这里提到的“cut entitlements”（削减权利性福利）意味着减少或限制人们根据这些法律或政策所拥有的获得特定福利（如社会保障金、医疗保险等）的权利。\n因此，当总统提出“Medicare solvency plan”并警告共和党可能“cut entitlements”时，这表明了一方面在寻求确保医疗保险系统的财务健康，另一方面则是关于政治争议，即对于是否应该减少公民通过法律有权获得的福利的争论。\nWASHINGTON—President Biden’s budget blueprint will kick off an election-year fight over Medicare and Social Security, as the president and his presumed Republican opponent, Donald Trump, scramble to lock down the support of the older voters who could decide which man occupies the Oval Office next year.","title":"Social Security, Medicare Fight Kicks Off With Biden Budget-WSJ"},{"content":"More Americans Are Treating Their 401(k)s Like Cash Machines Putting money in Pulling money out The 401(k) is doing double duty as both a retirement account and a source of emergency funds for more Americans.\nA record share of 401(k) account holders took early withdrawals from their accounts last year for financial emergencies, according to internal data from Vanguard Group. Overall, 3.6% of its plan participants did so last year, up from 2.8% in 2022 and a prepandemic average of about 2%.\na record share of A record share of\u0026quot; 这个短语的意思是指在观察的群体或数据集中，某个数量或比例达到了前所未有的水平。在这个上下文中，它指的是从401(k)账户提前取款的账户持有人的比例达到了历史新高。\nRetirement plans such as the 401(k) are designed to keep Americans’ nest eggs out of reach until later in life. And values in these accounts have risen substantially, in part because of a strong stock market and programs that automatically funnel money from people’s paychecks into their 401(k) accounts.\nnest eggs means a sum of money saved for the future.I worked hard to build up a nice little nest egg\n\u0026ldquo;Nest eggs out of reach\u0026rdquo; 的含义\n在这个上下文中，“nest eggs”指的是为退休储蓄的钱或资金，象征着个人为未来经济安全而积累的储备。短语“out of reach”字面意思是“够不着的”，“不可触及的”，在这里指的是设计使得这些退休储蓄不容易被提前使用或接触。因此，“nest eggs out of reach”整体上描述的是退休计划，如401(k)计划，被设计成让人们在退休前难以动用这些积蓄，以保证这些资金在人们晚年时可用。\n\u0026ldquo;Funnel money from\u0026rdquo; 的含义\n\u0026ldquo;Funnel money from\u0026quot;这个短语中，“funnel”在这里用作动词，意味着“导入”、“引导资金流动”的意思。短语“funnel money from\u0026hellip; into\u0026hellip;”因此指的是将钱从一个来源（如人们的工资）引导或转移到另一个地方（如他们的401(k)账户）。这里描述的是一个过程，其中一部分人的收入自动被转移或存入他们的退休储蓄账户，作为长期储蓄的一部分。这通常通过雇主提供的自动转账程序实现，使得个人能够持续而系统地为退休积累资金.\nThese surging balances, however, have helped make more people comfortable dipping into their accounts when needed.\n\u0026ldquo;Dip into\u0026rdquo; 是一个短语动词，意思是从某个资金来源、储蓄或积累中取出少量的钱或资源来使用。这个短语通常用来描述临时或非常规地使用储备的行为，尤其是当不打算使用大量资金时。在这个上下文中，“dip into their accounts”指的是人们在需要时从他们的账户（如401(k)退休账户）中提取一部分资金来应对短期的财务需求或紧急情况。这种行为反映了人们对于在必要时动用自己的储蓄持开放态度，尽管这些储蓄原本是为长期目标，如退休，而积累的。\nAmericans are dealing with conflicting financial forces. While hiring has been strong and workers’ earnings keep rising, the cost of groceries, child care and car insurance keeps climbing. More people are carrying heftier balances on their credit cards.\nEmergency distributions hit back-to-back record highs in 2022 and 2023, according to Vanguard, which administers 401(k)-type accounts for nearly five million people and published the data ahead of an annual report scheduled for June.\n这句话逐字解释如下：\n- Emergency distributions：紧急分发，指因特殊紧急情况而从账户中提取资金的行为。\n- hit：在这里，\u0026ldquo;hit\u0026rdquo; 是一个动词，意思是“达到”、“记录”。\n- back-to-back：连续的，指接连发生的事件，没有间断。\n- record highs：记录最高值，意味着达到了历史最高水平。\n- in 2022 and 2023：指的是具体的时间，这里是连续两年。\n- according to：根据，引入信息的来源。\n- Vanguard：先锋集团，一家提供金融和投资服务的公司，特别是管理401(k)等退休账户。\n- which administers 401(k)-type accounts：这部分提供了Vanguard的一个具体职能，即管理401(k)类型的账户。\n- for nearly five million people：为近五百万人，指Vanguard服务的客户规模。\n- and published the data：并发布了数据，说明Vanguard是公布这一信息的主体。\n- ahead of an annual report：在年度报告发布之前，表明这些数据是在正式的年度报告公布之前提供的。\n- scheduled for June：计划在六月，指年度报告预定的发布时间。\n整句翻译是：根据先锋集团的说法，2022年和2023年，紧急分发连续达到了记录最高值。先锋集团管理着近五百万人的401(k)类型账户，并在计划于六月发布的年度报告之前发布了这些数据。\n这句话的含义是，根据管理大量401(k)账户的先锋集团发布的数据，连续两年紧急从这些退休账户中提取资金的行为达到了历史新高，这一信息是在他们即将于六月发布的年度报告之前提前公布的。\nThe Internal Revenue Service allows withdrawals for hardship-related reasons, including preventing evictions and paying medical and tuition bills. People who take them from traditional accounts must pay income tax, plus often a 10% penalty if they are younger than 59½ years old.\neviction means the action of expelling someone, especially a tenant, from a property; expulsion.The forced eviction of residents\nNearly 40% of those who took a hardship distribution last year did so to avoid foreclosure, compared with 36% in 2022. In 2023, more than 75% of hardship distributions totaled $5,000 or less, according to Vanguard.\n\u0026ldquo;Foreclosure\u0026rdquo; 是一个名词，指的是债权人（通常是银行或其他贷款机构）因债务人未能按时偿还贷款而对债务人的财产进行的法律强制执行过程，最终导致财产的所有权从债务人转移到债权人。在住房贷款中，如果房主未能按照贷款协议偿还按揭贷款，银行或贷款机构可以启动房屋强制执行程序，以收回贷款。因此，\u0026ldquo;to avoid foreclosure\u0026rdquo; 意味着采取措施避免失去因未能偿还按揭贷款而面临的房屋被银行或贷款机构没收的风险。\n\u0026ldquo;Total\u0026rdquo; 可以用作动词，意味着计算总和、达到总数或总计为某个数量。当用作动词时，\u0026ldquo;total\u0026rdquo; 描述了将各个部分加起来得到总量的行为，或者指某些数量的总和。在给出的上下文中，\u0026ldquo;totalled\u0026rdquo; 指的是困难分配（hardship distributions）的金额合计达到了某个特定的数值。因此，\u0026ldquo;more than 75% of hardship distributions totalled $5,000 or less\u0026rdquo; 的意思是，超过75%的紧急分配（因财务困难提前从退休账户中取款）的金额合计为5000美元或更少。这里使用\u0026quot;totalled\u0026rdquo; 作为动词，来表示这些分配的金额汇总。\nRecent changes in federal law have loosened the rules governing when people can tap their retirement accounts for hardship-related reasons. For example, under a 2018 law, Congress did away with a requirement to take a 401(k) loan before a hardship distribution.\ndid away with：这个短语意味着彻底去除或取消某事。在这个句子中，它表示国会取消了之前的一个要求。\nAbout 13% of participants had a 401(k) loan outstanding at the end of 2023, up from 12% the year before. As interest rates have risen, more investors may be turning to 401(k) loans to avoid higher-cost debt, said Dave Stinnett, head of strategic retirement consulting at Vanguard.\n在这个上下文中，“outstanding”用来形容“401(k) loan”（401(k)贷款），意味着在2023年末仍未偿还或未结清的贷款。当说某笔贷款是“outstanding”，就是指这笔贷款还在持续中，借款人尚未完全还清。因此，这句话表示约13%的参与者在2023年结束时还有未偿还的401(k)贷款，这个比例从前一年的12%有所上升。\nThe law allows participants to borrow generally up to half of their balance, or $50,000, whichever is less. Stinnett said many workers like the idea of borrowing from themselves, since that means they repay their own account over time, along with interest set by the retirement plan.\n这段话解释了一项法律规定，允许参与者从他们的401(k)退休账户中借款，借款额度通常最多可达账户余额的一半，或者$50,000美元，取二者中的较小值。Stinnett提到，许多工作者喜欢自己从自己的账户借款的想法，因为这意味着他们随着时间的推移将钱还给自己的账户，同时还要支付由退休计划设定的利息。\n在这句话中，“since that”引导原因状语从句，用来解释为什么许多工作者喜欢自己从401(k)账户中借款的原因。这里的“since”作为连词，意味着“因为”，用于引出之前陈述（许多工作者喜欢从自己账户中借款）的原因或理由。而“that”在这里指代前文提到的借款行为及其相关的条件和结果，即他们可以随时间向自己的账户还款，并支付利息的整个过程。简言之，“since that”在这里用来说明工作者倾向于这种借款方式的理由，因为它允许他们最终向自己的账户还款，包括退休计划设定的利息。\n“along with”是一个短语，用于表示附带、伴随着或同时发生。在这个句子中，它用来说明在还款过程中，工作者不仅仅是还款本金，还要支付一定的利息。这里的“interest set by the retirement plan”（退休计划设定的利息）是随着本金一起被偿还的，这强调了还款包含了两个部分：本金和利息。因此，“along with”用于展示除了主要的还款外，还有其他事项（即利息）需要一并处理。\nThose who default on loans from traditional pretax 401(k) accounts must pay income taxes and often a 10% penalty on the unpaid balance.\nAverage account balances rose 19% in 2023, according to Vanguard, a welcome change from 2022, when falling stock and bond markets wiped 20% from the average 401(k) balance.\nThe growing popularity of automatic enrollment has moved more workers into 401(k) accounts. Among the more than 1,500 employer plans that use Vanguard’s 401(k) administration services, 59% automatically enrolled new hires in 2023, up from 34% in 2013.\n在这个上下文中，“up from”是一个表达增长或上升的短语，用来比较两个不同时间点的数据或百分比。当说“59% automatically enrolled new hires in 2023, up from 34% in 2013”时，意思是在2023年有59%的新雇员被自动注册进401(k)账户，而这个比例在2013年是34%。因此，“up from”用于指出过去的数值（34%）和当前或更近时间的数值（59%）之间的增长，强调了自动注册新雇员进401(k)账户的做法在这段时间内的普及率有显著上升。\nNearly three in 10 plans with automatic enrollment started workers out at a savings rate of 6% of pay or higher. In 2013, just 13% of plans with auto-enrollment used a starting savings rate of 6% or more.\nMore people are increasing their 401(k) contribution rates annually, in part because of programs that put retirement savings on autopilot, said Stinnett.\nA majority of plans that automatically enroll new hires also automatically increase employees’ savings rates, typically by 1 or 2 percentage points a year until reaching a cap that is often 10% or more of pay, according to Vanguard. Employees are free to opt out.\n大多数自动注册新员工的计划还会自动提高员工的储蓄率，通常每年增加1或2个百分点，直到达到一个上限，这个上限通常是工资的10%或更多。员工可以选择退出。\nA record 43% of 401(k) participants saved more in 2023 than they did in 2022.\nThe spread of such auto-escalation programs has helped boost the money going into these accounts. Workers contributed an average of 11.3% of pay, including the employer match, in 2022, the latest year for which data are available from Vanguard. That is up from 10.4% in 2016, and close to the 12% to 15% annual savings rates that many advisers recommend.\nWrite to Anne Tergesen at anne.tergesen@wsj.com\nAnne Tergesen is a reporter covering retirement in The Wall Street Journal\u0026rsquo;s Life \u0026amp; Work and personal finance departments in New York.\nHer stories often explore how retirement and preparing for retirement are changing today.

It is a simple case but the crime suspect is still on the loose up to today.\nWoman whose mystery poisoning captivated China for decades dies By Chris Lau and Simone McCarthy, CNN 4 minute read Updated 3:13 AM EST, Mon December 25, 2023 A woman who was left incapacitated for decades after being poisoned as a college student in a high-profile cold case in China has died at the age of 50.\nZhu Ling died in Beijing on Friday, her alma mater Tsinghua University announced in a post on the Chinese social media platform Weibo, which has been flooded with condolences.\n“Zhu Ling has fought tenaciously against the pain for many years. Throughout Zhu Ling’s life, she has always had care, support and encouragement from many alumni, different communities and the school,” wrote the prestigious Beijing-based university, often called “China’s MIT,” in the Saturday post.\nZhu’s death on Friday evening was also confirmed by her father Wu Chengzhi to the Southern Metropolis Daily, the news outlet reported Saturday. She would be buried in Beijing, he was quoted as saying. A funeral for Zhu was held in Beijing Sunday, state-affiliated Jimu News reported.\nIn 1994, Zhu was a second-year chemistry major and accomplished musician at Tsinghua, when she began to experience stomach pain, hair loss and other seemingly inexplicable symptoms that were later found to be signs of thallium poisoning, state media outlets have previously reported.\nThe highly toxic chemical – used in rodent and insect poisons – left Zhu practically blind and with the mental capacity of a 6-year-old.\nShe had suffered for months and ultimately fell into a coma before the cause of her ailment was diagnosed. Despite suspicion of foul play and a police investigation, no one has ever been charged.\nZhu’s case has captured the attention of the country across the decades since she was poisoned, sparking outrage and calls for justice. On Saturday, her death was the top search item on Weibo, with more than 400 million views by Saturday afternoon, as grief poured in from Chinese internet users.\n“When I think of her unpredictable ordeal lingered on for 30 years, the hardship beyond words, and the lack of justice, I felt a sense of anger that cannot be tamed,” wrote Yan Feng, a linguistics professor from Fudan University who has 5.5 million followers on Weibo. “May the deceased rest in peace and the living be in calmness.”\n“The girl who loved the guqin has left us like this, I wish her a good journey! There will be no more pain in heaven!” said another comment with more than 10,000 likes, referring to a Chinese musical instrument Zhu played.\nAn inconclusive investigation Other social media users Saturday focused on the Chinese authorities’ fruitless investigation and past accusations that the probe may have been dropped due to the powerful connections of a former suspect’s family. Their comments echoed calls for accountability in the case that have flared periodically in China.\n“The main reason that Zhu’s case evokes so much public anger and sympathy is because many people in China see a piece of themselves in Zhu: They have suffered injustice of some sort, but there is never a fair, independent or transparent investigation by the authorities,” said Yaqiu Wang, research director for China at the Washington DC-based non-profit Freedom House.\n“Zhu’s devoted parents, who took great care of her for nearly three decades, also symbolize the familial care that people in China intimately know and have to rely on, because the system is not something you can trust and depend upon.”\nRights groups have long criticized political influence over China’s notoriously opaque justice system, even as Beijing says it maintains – and has strengthened – rule of law.\nFollowing the poisoning, police had investigated one of Zhu’s roommates, Sun Wei, but subsequently cleared her as a suspect, according to previous reporting from state news agency Xinhua.\nMany netizens in the past have linked the uneventful probe to Sun’s family background.\nIn 2013, when a fatal poisoning case at a Shanghai college dorm in April rekindled national interest, social media users launched a petition to the United States government calling for it to take action against the former suspect, who they believed to be residing in the country.\nSun’s grandfather was a high-ranking official in the Nationalist government before the Communist takeover of China in 1949. He later held senior – though largely symbolic – positions in the People’s Republic until his death in 1995.\nOne of Sun’s father’s cousins was considered a national leader from 1993 to 2003 when he was a vice-chairman of China’s top political advisory body.\nSun has reportedly made a few online statements on Tianya, a Chinese Internet discussion forum, over the years, including one in 2005, in which she said police cleared her as a suspect in 1998 due to lack of evidence.\nSun, who state media has reported had access to thallium in the university laboratory, said she was not the only student with access to the toxic substance and denied personal animosity between herself and Zhu. Addressing her family’s political connections, she said her grandfather had died by the time she was questioned.\nIn 2006, Sun said her family had submitted an application to the police on her behalf requesting the authorities re-open the investigation to “find the truth.”\nIn 2013, when the Shanghai case piqued public interest again over Zhu’s case, Sun resurfaced on the Tianya platform and wrote: “I, more than anyone else, would like to bring the real perpetrator to justice.”\n","permalink":"https://codingnj.github.io/en/posts/essay/es0000/","summary":"Merry Christmas!\nThis case always makes me sad.
